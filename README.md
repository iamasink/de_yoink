# de_yoink

Probably the best Counter Strike 2 map ever to exist.  
The (not) award winning map de_yoinking, in all its glory, is now available for Counter Strike 2: Global Offensive.    
We have taken the time to port this map to the latest version of Counter Strike, and we hope you enjoy it.  
It is a very balanced map, and we hope to see it in the next major.  
Thank you for your time, and enjoy the map.  
Also this map is not a joke, it is a serious map, and we hope to see it in the next major.    
Thanks to Github Copilot for this paragraph.   

maybe something else should be used instead of github for this, i dont know, i dont care
